#VSCode Jetbrainish Icons

Forked from [webstorm icons](https://github.com/pmsandhu/webstorm-icons). 

First reason to fork - just to remove the folder arrows in tree view.
Other reasons - bugfixes & my personal improvements.

#How to install
Just download file vscode-jetbrainish-icons-X.X.X.vsix and install it manually in extensions tab of VSCode.
